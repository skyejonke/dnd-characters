## Usage

### Building a character sheet

It is reccomended to look at pre-existing character sheets in the `characters` directory when using this repository for the first time, each text input area of the character sheet is fillable with functions defined in the template, however it may require some trial and error to have the sheet looking as you intend.

### Compliation

If you use this as a template repository, there is a configured [GitHub Action](https://github.com/matsavage/dnd-latex-action) which will compile all `.tex` files in the `characters` directory to PDF sheets in situ. Alternatively it is reccomended to use XeLaTeX and the [DnD 5e LaTeX Template](https://github.com/rpgtex/DND-5e-LaTeX-Template) if compiling locally.

### Customisation

There are a large number of character sheet customisation options available in [`character-sheet-settings.tex`](https://github.com/matsavage/DND-5e-LaTeX-Character-Template/blob/documentation/character-sheet-settings.tex) which acts a central location to modify colour and opacity for a number of character sheet elements.

## Dependencies

This package requires LaTeX and the [DnD 5e LaTeX Template](https://github.com/rpgtex/DND-5e-LaTeX-Template). I reccomend using the [instructions](https://github.com/rpgtex/DND-5e-LaTeX-Template/tree/355b9ced1b42324574c2c4e28f9783f29c760a20#dependencies) provided with this package to set up your environment if not using the included GitHub action.
